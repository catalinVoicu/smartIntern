    <h2>Why smarTIntern?</h2>
    <p>
        By applying to ASAFF’s SmartIntern mobile app competition you get the chance 
        to take matters into your own hands and prove you’ve got what it takes to work 
        in this particular part of the IT field of work.
    </p>
    <p>
        It’s an opportunity to be creative, step out of your comfort zone and come up with an original idea.
        If your application is the best, you win an internship just like that: no stressful interviews or endless phone calls.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is suitable for all types of programmers, whether you prefer working alone or in a team
