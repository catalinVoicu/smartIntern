    <li>Team leaders should submit 3 to 10 screenshots of the application and a document with a presentation of the app. 
        <ul>
            <li>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The presentation should contain answers to these questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who you are?</li>
                    <li>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What does your application do?</li>
                    <li>  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Which platform did you use for development?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Teams are not able to submit after the deadline (8th of May 2013). Failure to comply to the deadline implies, inevitably, their disqualification.</li>
